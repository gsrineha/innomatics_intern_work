One of the built-in functions of Python is divmod, which takes two arguments and and returns a tuple containing the quotient of first and then the remainder

.

For example:

>>> print divmod(177,10)
(17, 7)

Here, the integer division is 177/10 => 17 and the modulo operator is 177%10 => 7.

Task
Read in two integers,
and , and print three lines.
The first line is the integer division (While using Python2 remember to import division from __future__).
The second line is the result of the modulo operator: .
The third line prints the divmod of and . 

SOl-

a = int(input());
b = int(input());
print(a//b);
print(a%b);
print(divmod(a,b));
