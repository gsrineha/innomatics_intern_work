You are asked to ensure that the first and last names of people begin with a capital letter in their passports. For example, alison heck should be capitalised correctly as Alison Heck.

Given a full name, your task is to capitalize the name appropriately.

def solve(s):
 s = str(s)
 for i in s[:].split():
  s = s.replace(i,i.capitalize())
 return s
